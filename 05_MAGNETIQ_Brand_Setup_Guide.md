We are a Maine-based nonprofit that uses arts and culture as powerful tools for social, economic, and environmental justice. Our annual Freedom & Justice Summit brings together world-class artists, local creators, and community members to explore how creativity can heal division and inspire transformation. From trauma-informed programming to intergenerational dialogue, we believe artists light the way toward freedom and justice in our communities.
```

### **What We Offer**

Multi-day arts activism summits, trauma-informed workshops, community healing experiences, and year-round programming that connects creativity with social change. We create spaces where art becomes medicine, stories become bridges, and community becomes the catalyst for justice.
```

Artists and creatives seeking platforms for social impact, social justice advocates, healing and wellness practitioners, trauma survivors, Maine cultural enthusiasts, educators and mental health professionals, and anyone who believes in the transformative power of art for community healing.

We combine world-class talent (like Maryland Poet Laureate Lady Brion) with intimate Maine venues, creating authentic cultural experiences. Our trauma-informed approach uses art specifically for healing, while our multi-generational programming bridges age gaps through shared creative expression. We're not just hosting events - we're building a movement where vulnerability becomes strength and creativity becomes activism.
